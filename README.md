## What does the script do?
This script will open a Chrome browser on Windows with an extension that changes all the pictures/logo's into Nicholas Cage. This may be a gif or just a static picture.
The script also looks for already existing CHrome browser shortcuts on the Desktop and replaces them with a shortcut to open Chrome with the extension
